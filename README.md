# MEng Thesis

## KunalSimulation

Contains code for the new mathematical model as well as scripts used to generate all the figures in the report. MATLAB .fig files are too large for github, so I have included the png versions.

## real\_data\_and\_preprocessing

Contains data from 5 experiments, as well as the algorithm running on Lacewing that preprocesses this data to produce figures. Ripped from the Lacewing_UI repository (can't remember exactly where it was). C'est La Vie

## proposed_algos

Contains jupyter notebooks for the proposed spatio temporal algorithms. One notebook uses real experimental data obtained from the real\_data\_and\_preprocessing repo (saved as txt files in this folder) and the other uses simulator data. Simulator data could not be uploaded to github due to size constraints (txt file >200mb). However you can take a look at the notebook and use the simulator to generate text files with the correct name on your local machine.

## Final deliverables

Powerpoint presentation and report are included.

## Enjoy!
